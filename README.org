* Hfood - Diet tracking with rocket fuel (haskell)
Hfood shall become a comprehensive framework for tracking your daily food intake.
** hfood-lib
   At the core, a library provides the datastructures and functions to fill them with data and query them for information.
   A CLI-wrapper for this might as well be added.
** hfood-web
   To make it easily accessible for anyone and also (someday) usable on mobile devices, a neat web app is required.
** eldiet
   For the Emacs lovers (e.g. me): An Emacs package, possibly with nice org-mode
   integration and options to e.g. show your calories in the modeline will be built.
